        "In Colab: Upload train.csv, test.csv, etc., or mount your Drive folder.\n",
        "Customize:\n",

        "Start Simple: The baseline model here is a good starting point. Aim for a public leaderboard score to gauge performance.\n",
        "Iterate: Use validation scores to experiment with features, models, or hyperparameters.\n",
        "Learn from Others: Check top notebooks in the competition’s “Code” tab for inspiration (e.g., feature engineering, ensemble methods).\n",
        "Resource Limits: Kaggle provides 30 hours of GPU time weekly; Colab’s free tier has 12 hours. Monitor runtime to avoid timeouts.\n",
        "While Waiting\n",
        "This notebook doesn’t depend on your AffectNet upload, so you can test it with a public Kaggle dataset (e.g., Titanic or Digit Recognizer) to practice.\n",
        "Once your train upload finishes, we can return to the AffectNet notebook.\n",
